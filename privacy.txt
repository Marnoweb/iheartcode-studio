/* The thing about Privacy. */

/* IN SHORT! */
  We respect our users.
  Our guiding principles:
 	-> Respect your users and their data.
 	-> If you really want to get know a user better, drop them an email!  [No snoopin' around./]
  
  Please feel free to get in touch!  [Contact info at bottom.]
  
  
/* MORE */
  Good to know:
 	-> We do NOT store anything about you other than your email address.  [The bare minimum!]
 	-> We have a ZERO email policy. The only time we do email you is to inform you that someone has used this service logged in with your email account.  [We hope it really was you. :) ]

  Of transparency & openness:
 	-> We support openness of the web.  [Freedom.]
 	-> So we have turned off all logging mechanisms to avoid collecting unwarranted information on user activity.  [We expect our good users to let us know if something went wrong.]
 	-> Our ENTIRE source code is hosted on GitHub.  [You can browse it to see if we're lying! :D ]

  Of security:
 	-> We use a federated login system using trusted Web standards like OpenID.  [So no storing of potentially sensitive information!]
 	-> If you trust your email provider, you can rest assured of your security!


/* PHILOSOPHY */
  " All the great things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word:
  	freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope. "
	~ Winston Churchill

  " Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves. "
	~ Abraham Lincoln

  " Freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err. "
	~ Mohandas Gandhi 


/* LEGAL */
  If you have any complain at all,
  we'd really appreciate it if you let us know.
  
  We will go to all lengths to get it resolved!
  
  Yet, if you do file a lawsuit against us,
  do at least inform the media,
  we'd love some publicity!
